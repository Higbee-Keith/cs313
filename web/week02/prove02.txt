After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
https://rocky-depths-30017.herokuapp.com

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/Higbee-Keith/cs313.git

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
Simple home page.  There isn't much to it, nor does it look that great. But hey, it's functional.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
None

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Nothing cool, just a refresher.

6. What is the difference between an HTTP Get and Post? When should each be used?
GET is used to retrieve remote data and POST is used to update remote data.  GET also appends the variables and their values to the URL string, but POST does not.  POST sends the data in the message body of the HTTP request..

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
D - Meets requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
The assignment has some minimum standards that must be met.  I believe I have met those minimum standards, but did not go further with it.  More content and styling could have been done to go above and beyond, but due to time and frankly, a non-creative eye, it was left at this point.
