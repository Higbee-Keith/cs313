After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
https://rocky-depths-30017.herokuapp.com/week05/self/index.php

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://git.heroku.com/rocky-depths-30017.git
https://github.com/Higbee-Keith/cs313

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
1. Most Recent:  A list of the 5 most recent entries.
2. Entry search: Will return all entries related to the specified tag.  A few examples are family, party, school, hobby.
3. Entry search: A search box that returns all entries related to the specified date.  The list of available dates are shown in the 5 most recent entries.
4. Entry search: Will return all entries related to the specified mood.  A few examples are Happy, Sad, Somber, Excited

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
The entry form to create a new journal entry is not yet functional.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Learning how to perform sql queries within php.

6. Why should you create a separate user account for your application to access the database?
This helps to limit the permissions the account has to only what it needs.  An account that only needs to run queries, as an example, should not have the permission to insert data or delete tables.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I'm not too keen on with the way the page currently looks, but I am happy with how the functionality is coming along with a few different search functions that pull the requested data per function.
